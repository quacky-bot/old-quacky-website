    <h2>What information is stored?</h2>
    <p>The following information is stored:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When you join the server your join message's messageid is stored as the latest member joined. This gets replaced once someone else joins the server.</li>
      <li>If you are a staff member and are allowed to apply for Support Team, your userid gets stored until you apply.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why we store the information and how we use it.</h2>
    <p>The messageid is stored in case you leave so the bot can edit the join message and say "You left"</p>
    <p>The userid to apply for Support Team is stored so the bot knows you're eligible to apply.</p>
    <p>If you are a donator and make a custom donator role, your userid and the role's id is stored.</p>
    <h2>Who gets this data?</h2>
    <p>The messageid data can only be seen by admins, but really anyone can figure out that you're the latest person to join and get your userid.</p>
    <p>The userid to apple for Support Team data can only be seen admins, unless you tell someone you're applying</p>
    <p>The roleid and userid is used so you can change the color of the role and for the role to delete when you leave the server.</p>
    <h2>Questions and Concerns.</h2>
    <p>If you are concerned about the data stored create a Support Ticket via the !new command.</p>
    <h2>How to Remove your data.</h2>
    <p>To remove your data, open a Support Ticket via the !new command.</p>
