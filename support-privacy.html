    </ul>
    <h2>Why we store the information and how we use it.</h2>
    <p>The messageid is stored in case you leave so the bot can edit the join message and say "You left"</p>
    <p>The userid to apply for Support Team is stored so the bot knows you're eligible to apply.</p>
    <h2>Who gets this data?</h2>
    <p>The messageid data can only be seen by admins, but really anyone can figure out that you're the latest person to join and get your userid.</p>
    <p>The userid to apple for Support Team data can only be seen admins, unless you tell someone you're applying
