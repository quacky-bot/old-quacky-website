    <h2>Being Professional in Support Tickets</h2>
    <p>Being a Support Team Member means that you are representing Quacky Bot, so please be professional in Support Tickets.</p>
    <p>Not being professional in Support Tickets can get you removed from the Support Team!</p>
    <h2>Reports</h2>
    <p>If a user opens a ticket as a report, all online moderators (not on mobile) will be mentioned to investigate the report.</p>
    <p>If the report is fake, just close the ticket for "Not a real report" or something else along those lines.</p>
    <h2>Ticket Blacklisting</h2>
    <p>If you believe that someone is creating fake support tickets to be a troll, please contact an admin.</p>
    <p>Admins will investigate the situation and take moderation actions if necessary.</p>
    <h1>Support Ticket Commands</h1>
    <h2>Support Team Commands</h2>
    <h3>Closing Tickets</h3>
    <p>To close a ticket, do !close [reason]</p>
    <p>The ticket user will be dm'd that the ticket is closed and, a message will say who closed it and why.</p>
    <p>When a ticket gets closed, it gets moved to the Ticket Archive. This archive is visible to the Ticket Owner and the Rest of the Support Team.</p>
    <h3>Renaming Tickets</h3>
    <p>To rename a ticket do !rename [prefix]</p>
    <p>The ticket "prefix" is what comes before the user's name. For example "!rename hello" would rename the ticket to #hello-username</p>
    <h2>Moderator Commands</h2>
    <h3>Adding people to Tickets</h3>
    <p>To add someone to a support ticket do !add [user]</p>
    <p>The user will be dm'd that they've been added to the ticket, and a message will say that they've been added to the ticket.</p>
    <h3>Removing people from Tickets</h3>
    <p>To remove a person from a support ticket do !remove [user]</p>
    <p>A message will say that they've been removed from the ticket, but the user being removed will not be notified about being removed.</p>
    <h3>Transferring Ticket Owners</h3>
    <p>To transfer the ticket owner to another user do !transfer [user]</p>
    <p>Both users (the old and new owner) will be dm'd about what happened and the ticket name will change and become #ticket-username</p>
    <p>The old owner will have access to the ticket as if they were added to it.</p>
    <p><i>NOTE: Transferring tickets to blacklisted user requires an admin.</i></p>
